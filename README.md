# SF Movies - Full Stack
This project is built off of Python 2.7.5, Django 1.6.2, Django-Haystack 2.1.0 and PyGeocoder 1.2.2 and Google Maps JavaScript API v3. All of these technologies I am proficient in and work together to provide most of the functionality needed for this application.

### Future Enhancements:
- Ensure all locations geocode to San Francisco.
- Allow multiple films to share the same Title.
- Make the UX aesthetically pleasing.
- Center and Zoom Map appropriately based on Markers.
- Integrate movies with IMDB.
- Take advantage of Django's caching framework.
- Separate films app from sfmovies project to be reused on other projects.
